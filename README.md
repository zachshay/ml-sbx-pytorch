# ml-project-mnist-1
Learn PyTorch with MNIST (handwritten digits), and see the difference between training on cpu and traiing on gpu.  My laptop has an M2 Max chip with 32 GB of RAM; my accelerator is "mps."

This repository hosts a variety of assets related to the above goal.
* python code for model definitions
* scripts providing various utility functions
* integrate with tensorboard

TODO (no priority):
* define more models (mlp; resnet8)
* introduce cross validation
* compare models in notebook
* containerize best model, wrap with GUI, deploy on cloud
