# ml-project-mnist-1
Compare and contrast implementing MNIST models with and without accelerators (e.g., gpu)

This repository hosts a variety of assets related to the above goal.
* python code for model definitions
* jupyter notebooks detailing how models were tuned
* scripts providing various utility functions
* additional assets for the containerization & orchestration of workloads

Important Notes:
* Accelerated training will leverage my local laptop's resources (i.e., Apple Silicon)
* Depending on cost estimates, I will enhance this code to leverage containers & cloud infrastructure
