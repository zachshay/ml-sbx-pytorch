# ml-project-mnist-1 (data dir)
This folder should hold your data.

The root folder's .gitignore hides a variety of files referenced by my code.

Please recreate these folders manually:
* mnist-archives
* mnist-testing
* mnist-training

Please procure the relevant files & unarchive them; they can be found here:
